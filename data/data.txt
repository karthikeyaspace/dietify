The beauty of a creamy pumpkin soup (and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular) is that it’s so versatile and forgiving. It’s one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, and it’s almost impossible to mess up. We love
easy soup recipes
, and know our community of home cooks do too.
What makes this our best easy pumpkin soup recipe?
The recipe author, Valli Little, originally created this creamy pumpkin soup recipe way back in 2004 and it was passed on to us here at taste.com.au as one of the first pumpkin soup recipes we ever published online. Since then, it’s become one of the most popular creamy pumpkin soup recipes in Australia, with more than 350 rave reviews to date.
It’s creamy without being heavy, delicately spiced without being spicy, and hearty without being too rich. Pretty much everything we look for in a pumpkin soup (and we’ve tried a lot of pumpkin soup recipes over the years!).
Creamy pumpkin soup: ingredients guide
Pumpkin:
Because pumpkin really is the hero (no surprises there!) it's best to pick your pumpkin wisely. We Originally made this pumpkin soup recipe with butternut pumpkin (or butternut squash for our international readers), but kent (or jap) pumpkin also works well. The Taste Test Kitchen team advises against some of the rarer types of pumpkin as they may give more watery results.
Spices:
While it can be tempting to skip the coriander, cumin and nutmeg, they really do bring warmth and flavour to this pumpkin soup. If you haven't matched pumpkin and nutmeg in a recipe before, it really is a revelation!
Onion and leek:
To get the most out of this creamy pumpkin soup, ensure you soften the onion and leek until they just start to release some of their juices and flavours, but don’t go so far as to let them caramelise. This gives the soup a subtle sweetness of flavour without any bitterness.
Cream:
While some recipes use coconut milk, in this pumpkin soup recipe we use thin cream instead of coconut milk to achieve a luscious consistency.
Potato:
The ultimate thickener in so many soups, adding a potato really amps up the heartiness of your pumpkin soup.
Stock:
A good quality stock has the power to elevate almost any soup. In this recipe, we recommend either chicken or vegetable stock.


Serve this pumpkin soup with a satisfyingly crusty piece of bread. If you like, you can sprinkle your soup with chilli flakes (or cayenne pepper) or a pinch of smoked paprika.

Australia's favourite classic zucchini slice recipe
Our most-loved zucchini slice recipe ever
While the argument as to what is Australia’s national dish will always rage (is it roast lamb, green chicken curry or a barramundi burger)? One thing is for sure, zucchini slice is hands-down the national food of the home cook.
Your lamb, barra and curry may turn up on the menu of a restaurant, but our favourite savoury slice never will. It’s too humble. It just moseys its way into lunch boxes, dinners and even canapes. There’s a reason zucchini slice is taste.com.au’s most popular recipe of all time - it’s simpler than a quiche, tastier than an omelette, and it just works.
Why this is our favourite zucchini slice recipe
This particular zucchini slice recipe is without doubt the best we’ve tasted (and we’ve tried a lot over the years). Originally submitted by Artarmon Public School in Sydney, it not only has the endorsements of more than 1,000 reviewers, but it’s also been tasted by school kids and the taste team’s tough food critics alike.
It manages to pack a big flavour and protein punch with just a handful of ingredients - eggs, zucchini, bacon, cheese and a few other staples - proving it’s totally possible to make a meal that can feed a whole family from pretty much nothing.
Key ingredients in zucchini slice:
Eggs:
zucchini slice is one of those recipes that ticks all the boxes in one go, and thanks to the addition of 5 eggs, you get plenty of protein in this dinner-turned-lunchbox-leftovers slice.
Flour:
to ensure the zucchini slice isn't too pancake-like, we use a cup of self-raising flour to create a little height and a satisfying, not-too-dense texture.
Zucchini:
the namesake vegetable star, zucchini (approximately 4 medium-large zucchinis makes up the 375g) shines in this slice. To make sure your mixture isn't too wet, try squeezing some of the moisture out of the grated zucchini (you can use a clean cloth, or just your hands to try to remove some of the liquid. A little moisture is welcome in the batter though, so no need to wring it all out. To save time, we use the grating plate on our food processor to grate the zucchini.
Onion:
while we generally use a brown onion for this recipe, you can certainly substitute for a red onion to bring extra flavour to the zucchini slice.
Bacon:
the salty deliciousness and colour of bacon plays an important supporting role in zucchini slice. Our Recipes Editor,
Sonya Gellert
, has also tested the recipe using plant-based 'bacon' (sometimes called 'facon') and tells us it also works well, if you want to make a vegetarian zucchini slice.
Cheddar:
grated cheddar cheese makes this slice all the more, well, moreish. For a budget-friendly hack, we buy a block of cheese (which is often more affordable than pre-grated) and grate it ourselves.
Vegetable oil:
this clever ingredient ensures your slice is one that won't dry out quickly, and will have a deliciously moist texture.

Easy fried rice recipe
Fried rice has long been a staple of Aussie takeaway dinners. And, while we might all have our favourite restaurant that makes Chinese fried rice just the way we like it, satisfying fried rice is a dish that's surprisingly easy to replicate at home. It's also a great way to use up any freshly cooked rice that's been leftover from the night before.
We've been making this particular fried rice recipe for more than 20 years, and it's the version we keep coming back to again and again. Why? It manages to pack in a lot of flavour for surprisingly little effort, and, if you follow our step-by-step tips, you really can create a DIY fried rice dish to rival your local takeaway joint.

What makes this our best fried rice recipe?
In this super simple egg fried rice recipe we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.
The real secret here is to use a large fry pan or wok on a very high heat so the rice is fried and golden, rather than steamed or gluggy. Cooking it this way ensures the fried rice still has bite and absorbs the lovely flavours of the bacon and soy, without resembling a risotto!

Easy fried rice: key ingredients
White, long grain rice
. Your fried rice will turn out best if you use cold, long-grain rice (like jasmine rice). It's really important to properly cool the rice down so if you're in a rush and just cooked the rice, spread it thinly on a tray, cover loosely with some cling wrap and pop in the fridge until cool.
Soy sauce.
We usually use whatever soy sauce is on hand, but of course you can use gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) or low-sodium soy sauce instead and still create a flavourful fried rice.
Oil:
A good neutral vegetable oil works best for frying, but you can add sesame for added flavour, if you like.
Bacon:
While we do think the bacon really helps the flavours in this dish, if you don't have it to hand, we have used ham as an alternative.
Peas:
frozen peas that have been thawed beforehand works best.
Carrot:
Adds colour and texture. We prefer grated or very finely julienned in this recipe.
Eggs:
We form an omelette with the eggs to mix through our fried rice, but you could always create a scrambled eggs texture, if you prefer.
Shallots:
Don't be tempted to skip these. They add colour, flavour and texture. If you've got a fussy eater in your household, you can dial them back a touch, but they really do help round out the flavours of the dish.
Additions:
Have some sesame oil and oyster sauce on hand? Brilliant! (We've listed vegetable oil here, but sesame oil brings extra flavour to your plate, as does a splash of oyster sauce or fish sauce). A great way to use up leftover veggies and protein, fried rice recipes can be bolstered with plenty of healthy ingredients and can easily be made vegetarian or vegan.

You could also jazz things up with kimchi to make a
kimchi fried rice

Delicious Thai beef salad recipe
Thai cuisine is one of contrasts and Thai beef salad is a perfect example. In the dressing alone, sweet meets salty, spicy and sour and in the salad intense chilli meets gentle aromatic herbs and cooling cucumber, all coming together in perfect harmony.

Why do we love this Thai beef salad recipe?
A much loved and ordered restaurant item, this Thai beef salad recipe brings this heavenly dish into your own home. The secret? While most Thai beef salad recipes just season and grill the meat, this recipe uses the ingenious trick of marinating it in half of the dressing. This not only flavours and tenderises the meat, but the palm sugar in the dressing helps caramelise the surface. Known as yum nua, this Thai beef salad is easy enough to be cooked as a weeknight dinner, but also special enough to be served as part of a Thai banquet.

Our best ever spaghetti bolognese recipe
Spaghetti bolognese, or spag bol, as it's affectionately known in Australia, is what most of us would consider to be the quintessential Italian meal. However, In Italy, the thick, slow-cooked Bolognese sauce is usually served with flat pasta or in a lasagne. This spaghetti bolognese recipe really is a great recipe. It's absolutely delicious, and here's why we love it so.

Why is this our favourite spaghetti bolognese recipe?
Our version starts with a soffritto mix of finely chopped onion, celery and carrot (plus garlic) and is flavoured further by diced tomatoes, oregano and nutmeg. This particular spaghetti bolognese recipe is diabetes-friendly, making it suitable for everyone's dinner. It's easy to make spaghetti bolognese at home on any night of the week, and you can freeze the ground beef meat mixture for future use. You'll thank yourself later! Our best spaghetti bolognese recipe (and yes, that's a big call) is one kids will love, adults will crave and ticks the nutritional boxes!

Our go-to classic minestrone soup recipe (with video)
Most of the classic Italian dishes are steeped in frugality. Known as cucina povera – meaning ‘peasant food’ or ‘poor kitchen’ - with this style of cooking nothing is wasted. Stale bread turns up in a
panzanella
, leftover cooked pasta is used in a
frittata
, and those jars or cans of tuna, capers and anchovies can be used to make a classic
puttanesca sauce
. This classic minestrone soup recipe is one for the ages. It's comforting, warming, full of healthy ingredients and is hearty enough to feed a crowd.
What is minestrone?
Minestrone soup is another fine example of this practical form of cooking. Laying somewhere between a soup and a stew, minestrone is more of a guide than a recipe. Always nourishing and simple to prepare, it opens itself to using whatever you have in the pantry or crisper drawer (see more about this below). Whatever you use, minestrone is a hearty, homey, bowl of goodness that costs next to nothing and is all cooked in the one pot.
Why we love this minestrone soup recipe
Our minestrone is also low in fat and high in fibre, making it nutritious as well as highly delicious and is ideal for dinners or a weekend lunch served with some crusty bread.
Key ingredients in our minestrone recipe:
Bacon:
bacon rashers add a salty, umami kick to minestrone, which can of course be omitted if you wish to make a meat-free soup.
Carrots, celery and potato:
these common crisper leftovers make a flavourful and health-giving addition to minestrone.
Garlic:
it would hardly be a hearty Italian soup recipe without the addition of garlic!
Stock:
we use beef stock for a rich depth of flavour, but you can use a vegetable stock if you prefer.
Canned chopped tomatoes:
finely chopped canned tomatoes bring a sweet richness to the soup-meets-stew.
Kidney beans:
we love how many budget-friendly canned ingredients can bolster this recipe. We use kidney beans but you could use cannellini beans, if you prefer.
Pasta:
we use a small shell pasta to bulk up this recipe, but any small pasta shapes you have in the pantry will work well here.
Parsley:
we use continental parsley, but this soup is great for using up fresh herbs, so feel free to get creative with what you have on hand.

Beef stroganoff recipe
I think of beef stroganoff as having the warm comforting taste of a slow-cooked stew with the cooking style of a stir-fry. In this beef stroganoff recipe, thinly sliced beef is sauteed until just sealed, but still rare (and never chewy!) Out of the pan it goes then in goes the onion and mushrooms, cooked until just tender.
Why is this the best beef stroganoff recipe?
In this version, the beef stroganoff sauce flavours are built up with some clever key ingredients. Although many stroganoff recipes use sour cream, we use creme fraiche for richness (see below for more details). Paprika is also the star of this recipe. Its mellow capisum flavour adds a touch of sweetness.
The result? Beefy, creamy deliciousness in only 25 minutes.
 
Key beef stroganoff ingredients
Tomato paste:
tomato paste is one of those hard-working ingredients where a little goes a long way to adding a salty-sweet umami richness to a dish, and beef stroganoff is all the better for a couple of tablespoons of the good stuff.
Mustard:
another cook's essential, mustard adds additional depth of flavour to our stroganoff sauce.
Crème fraîche:
velvety, creamy and tangy, crème fraîche works wonderfully in this beef stroganoff recipe (but you can use sour cream, if you prefer).
Paprika:
harking back to the original recipe, paprika brings its sweet-savoury vibrancy to this recipe.
What do you serve with beef stroganoff?
Beef stroganoff was originally served with roast potatoes or mashed potatoes, but you can also serve beef stroganoff with buttery pasta or egg noodles, ready to soak up the gorgeous creamy sauce.

Is time on your side? Why not try our
slow cooker beef stroganoff
so you can set and forget and it’ll be ready in time for dinner (our slow cooker beef stroganoff is one of our most popular beef stroganoff recipes). There are also plenty more

Cauliflower soup
While my younger self would be appalled, I love cauliflower. Whether it be in a creamy cheesy bake, a spicy Indian curry or as a substitute for rice. When the weather starts cooling down, it’s little wonder my thoughts turn to cauliflower soup. This cauliflower soup recipe hits the spot, with its silky texture, and mild and creamy taste.
Why this is our favourite cauliflower soup recipe
In this simple cauliflower soup recipe, the cauliflower florets are simmered in a seasoned chicken stock with sebago potatoes until super tender. When pureed until smooth the potato works as a thickener, providing body to the soup and slightly taming the cauliflower taste.
It’s no secret that cauliflower loves cream, and only half a cup is needed to create this cauliflower soup’s velvety texture. Although elegant enough for a dinner party entree, to me this is perfect bowl food to be eaten on the couch after the end of a long day.
Key ingredients in cauliflower soup:
Olive oil:
Imparting its subtle, fruity flavour, extra virgin olive oil is the starting point for this simple yet delicious soup.
Onion and garlic:
the building blocks of a great soup almost always start with this dynamic duo, which bring a moreish depth of flavour to the fore.
Cauliflower:
the key ingredient, cauliflower, is a versatile vegetable that cleverly absorbs the flavours of the onion, garlic and stock – and contributes to the creamy texture once blended.
Potato:
everyone’s favourite soup thickener, potato bolsters and thickens this speedy soup in budget-friendly style.
Stock:
we use a chicken-style stock because it’s a great flavour match, but you can substitute with whichever stock you have in your pantry.
Cream:
we up the luscious factor and make this meal something special with a little added cream. Yum!

Chilli con carne recipe
Wholesome chilli con carne recipe
With lean beef mince, red beans and a nice kick of heat, our hearty chilli con carne recipe is a family favourite. Serve with steamed white rice or as a filling for enchiladas or burritos.

I’ve been eating what we in Australia know as chilli con carne since childhood. Why not? It’s simple to prepare, low budget and loved by kids and adults alike. It wasn’t until I started researching the history of this beloved chilli recipe that I realised what a controversial dish it is to Americans. I won’t say that vendettas and feuds have been started over what should and shouldn’t go into a bowl of traditional chilli con carne (or chili, for those in the US) but there’s a lot of passionate opinion around the subject.
Opening a can of beans: should chilli con carne contain beans?
Known as the state dish of Texas, locals are adamant that a proper con carne should contain no tomato and no beans! Instead chunks of beef are simmered in ground smoked chilli with stock.
Here in Australia, we’re a bit more relaxed, to us it’s just beef, tomatoes and beans with a hit of chilli in our chilli con carne recipe. Our favourite chilli con carne recipe adds a couple of capsicums for good measure. This versatile chili con carne recipe serves eight, so freeze half for later, ready to be served on baked potatoes, corn chips or rice and topped with pickled jalapenos, shredded cheese and sour cream or rolled in burritos or baked into enchiladas.
What is chilli con carne made of?
Aussie chilli con carne is made on ground beef mince. We’ve gone with 5-star lean mince, which has helped give our chilli recipe a 8.8 health rating. Rather than using a combination of spices, we’ve used Mexican chilli powder, which is a mix of paprika, chilli, cumin and oregano. Adding the fresh chilli is up to you – add more or omit, it all depends on your heat tolerance. Some like to add extra ground coriander and a topping of fresh coriander too. Capsicum and chilli are from the same family so we’ve added a couple for extra fibre and colour. A traditional Texan chilli uses smoky dried chillies, but we’ve cheated by using smoked bacon.
Chilli con carne (or 'chili con carne' in the US) was an early invention in what later became known as Tex Mex cuisine, where Mexican flavours were added to dishes that were actually developed in Texas. This includes
original Texan nachos
that were simply cheese and jalapenos on corn chips, as well as
breakfast tacos
,
fajitas
,
queso
and
refried beans
.

Traditional roast lamb
Roast lamb is something Australians take very seriously. It’s in our blood, representing friends, family and general togetherness. It’s arguably our national dish.
When someone cooks lamb for you it all seems so effortless. I remember my grandmother just placing the leg into the old Kooka in the morning and taking it out when we were ready for lunch – no timers or adjusting temperatures and it was always perfect. For lamb is quite a forgiving cut of meat. it can be served pinkish or cooked through and the secret – even if it’s a bit overcooked, once served with our thick and rich homemade gravy all faults are hidden. 
When starting out on your own roast lamb journey, you’ll need a couple of guidelines and this is where this recipe is your best friend.  While lamb can carry many intense flavours, for a simple roast all you need is garlic and rosemary and of course salt. This recipe gives you the perfect rosy blush with a layers of sweet and crackling fat
Why we love this roast lamb recipe
We love this recipe as it reminds us what a difference basting makes when roasting a joint of meat. After an initial blast in a hot oven, we drop the temperature. We then start brushing the lamb with an oil, garlic and rosemary mixture that keeps the meat moist while infusing these wonderful flavours into the lamb. Serve leftovers in a sandwich with lots of cold butter and tomato chutney.
What do you need to make a traditional roast lamb?
Lamb leg
: You want to keep a fair bit of fat on it but get rid of extra large pieces.
Oil
: The olive oil adds flavour and helps transfer heat, allowing the outside of the lamb to become crisp.
Rosemary and garlic
: Both these flavours have a natural affinity with lamb, we finely chop them to form a paste. You may also see recipes that make incisions in the flesh of the lamb for little sprigs of rosemary and slices of garlic to be inserted, which also allow their flavours to infuse into the meat.
Potatoes
: Roast potatoes are a natural accompaniment for lamb. We use chat potatoes as they cook in very little time. Rather than a breed of potato, chat just means the new potatoes of the season.
Gravy
: No more reaching for the packet when you realise how easy it is to make your own. We use a good glug of red wine which adds a nice grown up flavour to the roast.

Roast lamb feature in many cuisines around the world. The French have fiver the slow cooked classic lamb
sept heure

crying lamb

While this tropical fruit is an American favorite, bananas are actually classified as an herb, and the correct name of a “bunch” of bananas is a “hand.” Technicalities aside, bananas are an excellent source of cardioprotective potassium. They’re an effective prebiotic, enhancing the body’s ability to absorb calcium, and they increase dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin – brain chemicals that counter depression.

Raspberries
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
Raspberries come in gold, black and purple varieties, but red are the most common. Research suggests eating raspberries may help prevent illness by inhibiting abnormal division of cells, and promoting normal healthy cell death. Raspberries are also a rich source of the flavonoids quercetin and gallic acid, which have been shown to boost heart health and prevent obesity and age-related decline.

Oranges
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
Oranges are one of the most potent vitamin C sources and are essential for disarming free-radicals, protecting cells, and sustaining a healthy immune system. Oranges contain a powerful flavonoid molecule called herperidin found in the white pith and peel. In animal studies, herperidin has been shown to lower cholesterol and high blood pressure. So don’t peel all the pith from your orange. Consider adding zest from the skin into your oatmeal for a dose of flavor and health.

Tangerines
Photograph by Danny Kim for TIME; Gif by Mia Tramz for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
A tangerine has more antioxidants than an orange, and this powerful little fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fiber that play a role in reducing disease risk and supporting weight management. Tangerines are a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which help lower the risk of chronic eye diseases like cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Animal studies have suggested that flavonoids found in tangerines may be protective against type 2 diabetes and heart disease, so use the zest on fruit and vegetables to reap the benefits of the fruit’s natural oils.

Tomatoes
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
Tomatoes are a nutritional powerhouse. They’re rich in lycopene, a potent weapon against cancer.

Eggplant
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Deep-purple eggplant is classified as a nightshade vegetable, kin to the tomato and bell pepper.

Beets
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
It’s hard to beat beets. Research shows they’re a good source of antioxidants and have compounds that can help lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. They also look lovely on your plate thanks to betalains—the pigment that gives them their color. Betalains are destroyed by heat, so steam beets or roast them for less than an hour to derive maximum nutrition benefits.
Serving size:

Winter Squash
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Winter squash is an inexpensive vegetable that’s as healthy as it is versatile. It’s one of the richest sources of plant-based anti-inflammatory beta-carotene, which can support healthy vision and cell development.

Tuna
Photograph by Danny Kim for TIME; Gif by Mia Tramz for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Experts recommend the general population, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, eat 8 to 12 ounces of seafood weekly to boost brain health and avoid the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Choosing fish rich in essential Omega-3 fatty acids like tuna–and even canned tuna–can promote immunity, heart health and may even lessen postpartum depression. Don’t go overboard, though—tuna can be high in mercury.

Sardines
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
Sardines are tiny but mighty, rivaling salmon when it comes to omega-3 fatty acid content. These fatty acids go to work immediately (as opposed to plant-based omega 3s), improving blood flow, feeding our brain, stabilizing heart rhythms and keeping inflammation in check. Sardines are also a source of calcium. Look for the varieties packed in olive oil for an added heart-health benefit.

Salmon
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
As we age, both intrinsic (our DNA) and extrinsic factors (the sun) take their toll. Skin can become dull, patchy, spotted and wrinkled, and while you might be tempted to go for a fancy face cream, what you eat may bring more potent results. How? Omega-3s in foods like salmon may help reduce dryness (from atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) and may even reduce the risk of skin cancer.

Poultry (Dark Meat)
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Light meat is a fine choice, but there’s no reason to be afraid of the dark. The fat in dark meat contains a hormone called cholecystokinin, or CCK, which is partly responsible for satiety, so a little bit of dark meat can go a long way, especially if you’re watching your weight. Further, dark meat contains myoglobin, a protein which delivers oxygen to muscle cells. Dark meat also has more B vitamins than white meat, making it a nutrient-rich protein source that’s tasty and satisfying, and meat from the leg and thigh are rich in taurine. Studies have shown that taurine can lower the risk of coronary heart disease in women and it may also help protect against diabetes and high blood pressure.

Almonds, like all nuts, are good sources of the antioxidant vitamin E, which may play a role in slowing cognitive decline with age.

Chia Seeds
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
Despite their tiny size, chia seeds deliver an incredible amount of nutrition. In a two-tablespoon serving, you’ll find 11 grams of fiber, four grams of protein, five grams of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, nearly 20 percent of a day’s worth of calcium, plus potassium and antioxidants.

Flaxseeds
Danny Kim for TIME
Why they’re good for you:
This tiny seed has more than 100 times the amount of phytonutrients as oats, wheat bran, millet and buckwheat. Flaxseed is a source of plant-based fatty acids, fiber, B vitamins, potassium and minerals like calcium and iron. Research suggests that flaxseed may lower cholesterol, help fight cancer, and lower the risk of osteoporosis.

Eggs

Why they’re good for you:
Eggs deliver essential vitamins and minerals in a very small package. Plus, they’re a low-calorie, low-fat source of extremely digestible protein. The egg yolk, in particular, is a source of choline, important for proper cell and nerve function. Experts say you can eat up to two eggs daily—because cholesterol in the diet does not appear to have an impact on cholesterol in the blood.

Kefir
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
This fermented milk drink is a cocktail of good-for-you microbia. It’s been shown to support immunity, improve lactose intolerance (despite that sounding counterintuitive), build bone density and fight cavities by minimizing oral bacteria. As with other dairy products, Kefir is rich in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and protein.

2% Greek Yogurt
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Conventional yogurt is an excellent source of calcium, potassium and protein, but the Greek varieties have double the protein, half the sodium and half the carbohydrates of regular yogurt. Probiotics such as
Lactobacillus acidophilus
and
Lactobacillus casei
are often added to yogurt, increasing healthy gut bacteria and bolstering immunity. While fat-free Greek yogurt has fewer calories than one percent Greek yogurt, the later has the ability to make fat-soluble vitamins (such as A,D,E and K) more bioavailable to the body and helps with satiety.

Coconut Oil
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Despite being high in saturated fat, coconut oil may good for your heart, weight and energy levels. Coconut oil is comprised of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) which are easily digested and have been shown to help the body burn fat and increase “good” cholesterol levels. More than 50% of coconut oil is comprised of lauric acid, and while lauric acid increases bad cholesterol, it raises your good cholesterol that much more. Some studies suggest improved exercise performance related to MCT consumption, but the data is not yet convincing.

Recipe from Tina Ruggiero: Coconut & Sesame Crusted Salmon
Ingredients
2 tablespoon panko
2 teaspoon toasted black & white sesame seeds
2 tablespoon unsweetened coconut
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 (4 oz.) salmon fillets
2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoon coconut oil
Preparation
In a small bowl, combine the panko, sesame seeds, coconut and sesame oil. Reserve.
Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper to taste. Spread ½ tsp. Dijon on one side of each fillet. Divide the coconut mixture between the salmon fillets, pressing it onto the Dijon.
Heat a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add the coconut oil and when it shimmers, add the salmon, coconut-side down, and cook for about 2 minutes or until golden. Turn the salmon and brown the other side, another 2 minutes. Turn heat down and continue to cook to desired doneness.
Olive Oil
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Due to its phenolic compounds, olive oil is enjoyed for its anti-inflammatory benefits in addition to its taste. It’s also recognized for contributing to lower rates of heart disease and obesity. The extra virgin variety retains the most number of antioxidants, since the oil comes from the first pressing of olives. No matter what variety is enjoyed, experts agree that olive oil has anti-cancer, cognitive, bone, cardiovascular and digestive health benefits.

Add scallops to skillet; cook 2 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Serve scallops with tomatoes; sprinkle with basil.
Cumin
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Cumin may be a common kitchen spice, but its health benefits are more than ordinary. Ground cumin may support heart health, fight infection, and combat inflammation; just one-half teaspoon of ground cumin has twice as many antioxidants as a carrot.

Turmeric
Danny Kim for TIME
Why it’s good for you:
Turmeric is a spice that comes from the root of the
Curcuma longa
plant, and its vibrant, orange color comes from curcumin. This pigment has been shown to be a potent anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agent. Some research has shown turmeric to be helpful in preventing Alzheimer’s and cancer.

Why it’s good for you:
Cinnamon’s health benefits come from the oil found in in its bark. These essential oils are suspected to have anti-clotting and antimicrobial power along with possessing the ability to reduce inflammation. Research shows that cinnamon may have the ability to improve insulin response as well as boost brain and colon health.

Scientists believe the flavonoids found in red wine lower the risk of coronary artery disease by reducing clotting, bad cholesterol and by boosting good cholesterol levels. The sweeter the wine, the fewer the flavonoids it contains. Cabernet, Petit Syrah and Pinot Noir have the most.

1. Stuffed sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes
are loaded with beneficial nutrients like beta carotene, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber (
1
).
Plus, they’re delicious and pair well with just about anything. This makes them the perfect base on which to build a filling meal.
At my house, we prepare stuffed sweet potatoes at least once a week. I roast a whole sweet potato, then stuff it with ingredients like sautéed veggies, beans, chicken, and cheese.
This meal is super versatile, and you can choose from a variety of flavor combinations. You can try out one of the simple recipes below or wing it and simply pile your favorite ingredients onto a roasted sweet potato.
Chicken Pesto Stuffed Sweet Potatoes
Taco Stuffed Sweet Potatoes
Vegetarian Stuffed Sweet Potatoes
Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes
2. Grain bowls
Grain bowls are a hit in my kitchen. My husband and I love how simple and adaptable grain bowls are and frequently prepare this dinner when we’re craving a flavorful yet easy-to-prepare meal.
I follow a gluten-free diet, so we use
gluten-free grains
like quinoa and brown rice. However, you can use any grain you want for grain bowls, including farro, millet, and barley.
Grains provide an important source of
fiber
and other nutrients like magnesium. Studies have found that diets rich in grains are linked to a lower risk of several health conditions, including colon cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (
2
).
To prepare a grain bowl, top a serving of cooked grains with cooked or raw veggies and a protein source like chicken, fried or hard-boiled eggs, grilled shrimp, or salmon.
Then top it with a store-bought or
homemade dressing
, or keep it simple with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.
For example, this
Green Goddess Buddha Bowl
uses an irresistible combination of brown rice, roasted broccoli, sugar snap peas, avocado, hard-boiled eggs, toasted pumpkin seeds, and a creamy yogurt-based sauce.
Here are a few more grain bowl recipes that make a perfect dinner option for nights when you’re short on time:
Thai Chicken Buddha Bowls
Salmon Grain Bowls with Lemon Tahini Sauce
Sweet Potato & Chickpea Buddha Bowl
3. Veggie loaded frittatas
Share on Pinterest
cheche22/Getty Images
When you have chickens like I do,
eggs
make their way into more than just breakfast meals. We regularly use eggs as the protein source for quick and tasty dinners, including frittatas.
Eggs have you covered when it comes to healthy fat and protein, so all you need to do is add a variety of your favorite veggies to cover your fiber needs.
Some of my favorite vegetables to use in frittatas include asparagus, spinach, sweet potatoes, zucchini, onions, broccoli florets, mushrooms, and tomatoes. You can also add in ingredients like cheese, herbs, spices, or pesto to give your frittata extra flavor.
You can even use leftovers like salmon, shredded chicken, and potatoes in your frittata.
I like to serve frittata with some sliced
avocado
or fresh fruit. It’s a filling meal that you can enjoy at any time of the day or night. Frittatas are super simple to make, and you can whip them up in under an hour.
Here are a few tasty and easy frittata recipes:
Spring Vegetable Frittata
Cheesy Chicken Pepper Broccoli Frittata
Wild Mushroom Frittata with Cheddar, Green Onions, and Peas
4. Dinner salad
A large, filling salad is one of my go-to dinners, especially when I’m not feeling up to putting time into a meal.
The problem with most salads is that they’re not well composed, and you end up feeling hungry again just a short while after finishing your meal. The key to making a hearty dinner salad is making sure that you include plenty of
protein
, healthy fats, and fiber.
Start with a base of your favorite greens, such as spinach, mixed greens, arugula, kale, or romaine. Add a few more veggies, such as peppers, cucumbers, carrots, broccoli, or red onions, to your greens to bump up the fiber content.
Then choose a protein source like grilled chicken, shrimp,
salmon
, or hard-boiled eggs. Adding a fiber-rich carb source, such as beans or roasted sweet potatoes, will bump the fullness factor even higher.
Top your creation with roasted sunflower or pumpkin seeds for a crunchy texture, then drizzle it with a healthy dressing like olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or follow this recipe for
Homemade Green Goddess Dressing
.
Here are a few more dinner salad ideas:
Chicken Shawarma Salad with Tahini Dressing
Superfood Salmon Salad
Crunchy Asian Chopped Salad
5. Loaded brown rice pasta
Most everyone loves a good pasta dish, but most pasta dishes don’t contain the necessary ingredients, such as protein and fiber, to keep you feeling satisfied (
3
).
Fortunately, using a few simple tips can help you create a filling and nutritious pasta dinner in no time.
First, choose your pasta. I am a big fan of
Tinkyada
brown rice pasta, but you can use any pasta you like. You can also use zucchini noodles in place of pasta if you’re following a lower carb dietary pattern.
Next, pick a source of protein. I like to use chicken breast or ground chicken or, if I want
plant-based protein
, I will add chickpeas.
Next, choose your veggies. I love a classic combo of spinach and broccoli, but almost any vegetable will work. Lastly, pick a sauce, such as pesto, marinara, or olive oil.
Here are a few recipes to try out the next time you’re craving a pasta dish:
Broccoli Pesto Chicken Pasta
Roasted Vegetable Chickpea Pasta Salad
Zucchini Noodles with Mini Chicken Feta and Spinach Meatballs
6. One-pot soups
Few meals are more satisfying than a hearty, hot bowl of soup. Fortunately, soup can be simple to prepare and makes a perfect choice for meal prep, as you can make large portions easily.
I like making soups that require only one pot because this means less time cleaning up. I make my soups on the stovetop, but you can make any of the following recipes in an Instant Pot to save time.
Creamy Yellow Split Pea Soup
Curry Chicken Soup
Lentil, Kale, and Quinoa Stew
7. Curry
Curry
is a smart choice for a quick, filling dinner because it’s versatile, easy to make, and family-friendly. Plus, eating curry regularly may help improve your health by reducing heart disease risk factors, including high triglyceride and blood sugar levels (
4
,
5
).
I like whipping up a warming chickpea and sweet potato curry during the winter months and serving it over rice or quinoa.
Many curry recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare, including these simple curry dishes:
Quick and Simple Thai Chickpea Curry
Easy 1-Pan Salmon Red Curry
30-Minute Thai Chicken Curry
8. Burgers
Burgers are a great choice for families because they’re simple to make and sure to please even the pickiest of taste buds.
Even though beef burgers are a popular choice, you can make burgers out of just about any protein source, including ground chicken, salmon, tuna, and
lentils
.
My husband makes a delicious chicken burger, and I like to serve it with a large salad and roasted sweet potato fries.
You can serve your burgers on a hearty whole grain bun, in a lettuce wrap, or on top of a bed of greens to suit your dietary needs.
Here are a few burger recipes that are super simple to prepare:
Chickpea Pizza Burgers
Spinach Feta Salmon Burgers
Seriously Good Sweet Potato Cheddar Barbecue Chicken Burgers
9. Whole roasted chicken
Share on Pinterest
Cameron Whitman/Stocksy United
Even though roasting a whole chicken may take some time, it couldn’t be any simpler. Check out this guide on how to roast a
perfect chicken
.
When I roast whole chickens, I stuff the bottom of the roasting pan with potato wedges, onions, and carrot chunks so the veggies cook along with the chicken.
When your chicken is done roasting, let it rest for 15 minutes before carving it. You can use that time to make a quick salad like the ones listed below:
Easy Tomato Avocado Salad
Favorite Green Salad with Apples, Cranberries, and Pepitas
Sun-Dried Tomato Salad with Olives and Feta
10. Sheet pan meals
If you’re not a fan of cleaning dishes, this idea is for you.
Most recipes require you to use several pots, pans, and bowls. However, sheet pan meals allow you to pile all of your ingredients onto a single sheet pan to cook, which saves you time in the kitchen.
Check out these mouthwatering sheet pan meals:
Sheet Pan Harissa Chicken with Chickpeas and Sweet Potatoes
Sheet Pan Lemon Brown Butter Salmon with Parmesan Asparagus
Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas
Vegetarian Mediterranean Sheet Pan Dinner

Garlic Lime Shrimp Kebabs
Lots of people are afraid to try seafood on the grill, but kebabs are an ideal way, because you won’t risk anything slipping down between the grates. Shrimp is an excellent source of lean protein, according to the
USDA
, and delivers the all-important omega-3s that most Americans don’t get enough of. Plus, it cooks quickly, so it’s a great fast meal when you’re in a hurry.

9. An Herb-Packed DIY Dressing
Salads are a mainstay of any healthy, balanced diet, and they're a great way to up your intake of fruits and vegetables. But bottled dressings are often high in fat, sodium, and added sugars, according to
MedlinePlus
. Making your own allows you to control those nutrients, and even swap them for better ones. This creamy dressing gets its texture from Greek yogurt, which adds gut-friendly probiotics, and uses herbs for flavor.

Homemade Green Goddess Dressing
Green Goddess dressing gets its name and bright flavor from the green herbs it contains. In this version,
Greek yogurt
stands in for less-healthy ingredients such as
mayonnaise
and full-fat
sour cream
— both of which are higher in unhealthy saturated fat according to the USDA. As a bonus, the Greek yogurt adds a natural tang to your dish.

8. A Heart-Healthy Chocolate Dessert
Avocados aren’t just for breakfast anymore! In this recipe, they replace dairy to make a frozen dessert that’s got more healthy fat than unhealthy fat (and is vegan-friendly, too). We can’t think of a better way to satisfy a chocolate craving.
Nadine Greeff/Stocksy
Chocolate Avocado ‘Ice Cream’
Avocados
in ice cream?! Avocados are packed with healthy monounsaturated fats and lend a rich and smooth texture to this frozen dessert while replacing the unhealthy saturated fats in traditional ice cream. According to
MedlinePlus
, monounsaturated fats are beneficial for lowering
LDL ("bad") cholesterol
and reducing risk of heart disease and stroke. A bonus: Avocados contain fiber — at 10 grams (g) per fruit, per the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

7. A Better-for-You Veggie Bacon
There are plenty of benefits to a plant-based diet, but one of the major drawbacks is never eating bacon again. This processed meat is one of the worst kinds for you — the results of a cohort
study published in
PLoS Medicine
in January 2023
showed that the additives used to cure the meat were linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. This clever carrot “bacon” allows you to enjoy the texture and flavor of bacon without those harmful preservatives.

Vegan Carrot Bacon
Bacon minus the pig might sound like a stretch, but liquid smoke and smoked paprika give these crisp carrots a meaty flavor that will satisfy omnivores and vegans alike. Plus, carrot “bacon” is significantly lower in sodium, calories, and saturated fat, according to data from the
USDA

6. An Upgraded Potato Pancake
Latkes are a traditional fried potato dish served during Hanukkah, but they make a great appetizer, side, or snack anytime, and especially when you cut back on the oil and use sweet potatoes, which add carotenoids. These plant pigments are associated with improved cognitive function and lower risk of dementia, according to
research published in the
Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease
in June 2023
.

Sweet Potato Latkes
Potato latkes (aka fried potato pancakes) are a Hanukkah staple. Unfortunately, the oil used to cook them adds a lot of calories. In this recipe, only a small amount of olive oil is used. Since olive oil is composed of mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (according to the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
) and since it's used sparingly, these latkes are lighter in calories and healthier than usual. Sweet potatoes (rather than white ones) add a natural sweetness to this traditional dish along with valuable nutrients such as vitamin A.
